# Multi-Participant-Chat

This is an example project for a multi participant chat implemented in Java. In this chat, participants can chat with each other, and each user can send messages to all users connected to the chat  (of course users are connected to the same local network from different computers). This project implements both the server side and the client side. In addition, the server side shows on the terminal which user logged in, disconnected, etc.
